MultipleTextEditor
==================

[DEPRECATED] Project is archived as being outdated for years.

Multifunctional string replacer featured by cool UI. The application was intended for automation of routine work on editing a set of files with text information. Multiple Text Editor allows searching many files in subdirectories and change the content of these files by the rules managed by user. While an end user works with nice UI controls, under the hood it works using a Regular expressions. For now application is slow and needs to be improved. My main concern on creating this app was learning of WPF design in that time, so don't get it really strong. And feel free to use it for your own.
